# Multi-Step Form

This is a simple React application that implements a multi-step form with validation, local storage support, and step progression. The form collects personal information and address details and then displays a confirmation page before submission. Data is saved in local storage, so users can continue filling out the form later without losing their progress.

## Features

- **Multi-Step Navigation**: The form is divided into multiple steps (Personal Information, Address Information, and Confirmation).
- **Input Validation**: Fields are validated before moving to the next step, ensuring that all required information is filled out correctly.
- **Local Storage**: Form data is saved to local storage, allowing users to resume the form later without losing data.
- **Error Handling**: Each form field shows error messages when validation fails.
- **Responsive Design**: The form is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
